`sshpiper` is the reverse proxy for sshd. all protocols, including ssh, scp, port forwarding, running on top of ssh are supported. 

*Note:* this is `v1` version, checkout legacy `v0` [here](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/tree/v0)

### Overview and Terminology

 * `downstream`: the client side, typicall ssh client 
 * `upstream`: the server side, typicall sshd server
 * `plugin`: handles the routing from `downstream` to `upstream`. the `plugin` are also repsonsible for the mapping authentication methods to upstream. for exmaple, the downstream may use password as authentication method, but the upstream may receive public key authentication mapped by `sshpiper`.
 * `addtional chanllenge`: some `plugin` will not do routing but add an additional challenges to ssh authentication to `upstream`. for example, the `downstream` may be asked for two factor authentication provided by the `plugin`.

```

## Quick start

### Build

```
git clone https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper
cd sshpiper
git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir out
go build -tags full -o out ./...
```

## Run simple demo

### start dummy sshd server

```
docker run -d -e USER_NAME=user -e USER_PASSWORD=pass -e PASSWORD_ACCESS=true -p 127.0.0.1:5522:2222 lscr.io/linuxserver/openssh-server
```

### start `sshpiperd` with `fixed` plugin targetting the dummy sshd server

```
sudo ./out/sshpiperd ./out/fixed --target 127.0.0.1:5522
```

### test ssh connection (password: `pass`)

```
ssh 127.0.0.1 -l user -p 2222
```

### âž• math before login? 

Here illustrates the example of `addional challenge` before the `fixed` plugin.

```
sudo ./out/sshpiperd --log-level=trace ./out/simplemath -- ./out/fixed --target 127.0.0.1:5522
```

## Plugins

### icons

 * ðŸ”€: routing plugin
 * ðŸ”’: addtional challenge plugin

Plugin list

 * [workingdir](plugin/workingdir/) ðŸ”€: `/home`-like directory to managed upstreams routing by sshpiped.
 * [workingdirbykey](plugin/workingdirbykey/) ðŸ”€: same as `workingdir` but uses public key to route.
 * [yaml](plugin/yaml/) ðŸ”€: config routing with a single yaml file.
 * [docker](plugin/docker/) ðŸ”€: pipe into docker containers.
 * [kubernetes](plugin/kubernetes/) ðŸ”€: manage pipes via Kubernetes CRD.
 * [totp](plugin/totp/) ðŸ”’: TOTP 2FA plugin. compatible with all [RFC6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) authenticator, for example: `google authenticator`, `azure authenticator`.
 * [azdevicecode](plugin/azdevicecode/) ðŸ”’: ask user to enter [azure device code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-device-code) before login
 * [fixed](plugin/fixed/) ðŸ”€: fixed targetting the dummy sshd server
 * [simplemath](plugin/simplemath/) ðŸ”’: ask for very simple math question before login, demo purpose
 * [githubapp](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper-gh) ðŸ”€: login ssh with your github account
 * [restful](https://github.com/11notes/docker-sshpiper) by [@11notes](https://github.com/11notes) ðŸ”€ðŸ”’: The rest plugin for sshpiperd is a simple plugin that allows you to use a restful backend for authentication and challenge.
 * [failtoban](plugin/failtoban/) ðŸ”’: ban ip after failed login attempts

## Screening recording

`sshpiperd` support recording the screen in `typescript` format (not the lang). The format is compatible with [scriptreplay(1)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scriptreplay)

To use it, start sshpiperd with `--typescript-log-dir loggingdir`

    Example:

    ```
    ssh user_name@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
    ... do some commands
    exit


    $ cd loggingdir/user_name
    $ ls *.timing *.typescript
    1472847798.timing 1472847798.typescript

    $ scriptreplay -t 1472847798.timing 1472847798.typescript # will replay the ssh session
    ```


## Public key authentication when using sshpiper (Private key remapping)

During SSH publickey auth, [RFC 4252 Section 7](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252#section-7),
ssh client sign `session_id` and some other data using private key into a signature `sig`.
This is for server to verify that the connection is from the client not `the man in the middle`.

However, sshpiper actually holds two ssh connection, and it is doing what `the man in the middle` does.
the two ssh connections' `session_id` will never be the same, because they are hash of the shared secret. [RFC 4253 Section 7.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-7).


To support publickey auth, `sshpiper` routing plugin must provide a new private key for the `upstream` to sign the `session_id`. This new private key is called `mapping key`.

How this work

## Migrating from `v0`

### What's the major change in `v1`
 
 * low level sshpiper api is fully redesigned to support more routing protocols.
 * plugins system totally redesigned to be more flexible and extensible.
   * plugins are now sperated from main process and no longer a single big binary, this allow user to write their own plugins without touching `sshpiperd` code.
 * `grpc` is first class now, the plugins are built on top of it

For plugins already in `v1`, you need change params to new params. However, not all plugins are migrated to `v1` yet, they are being migrated gradually. you can still use the old plugins in [`v0` branch](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/tree/v0)
